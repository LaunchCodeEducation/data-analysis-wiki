# Lesson 2: Lists and Strings

## In the prep work this week, the students learned:

1. What strings and lists represent and that strings are _immutable_.
1. How to use bracket notation to:
   1. Index into a string or list.
   1. Update list elements.
1. [Common string methods](https://education.launchcode.org/data-analysis/chapters/strings/string-methods.html#common-string-methods) and [Common list methods](https://education.launchcode.org/data-analysis/chapters/lists/list-methods.html#common-list-methods).
1. How to use template literals and how to include newlines (``\n``) and tabs (``\t``) in ``print`` output.
1. How to create and access a multi-dimensional list.

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Remind students of the due date for the first graded assignment.
1. Other items as needed...

### Lesson 2 Topics That Require More Attention

1. There is 1 open ended Check Your Understanding questions in the strings chapter. Spend time discussing:
   1. Given ``pet = 'cat'``, why do the statements ``print(pet + 's')`` and ``pet += 's'`` NOT violate the immutability of strings?
1. Zero-based indexing
1. Live code examples for using ``split`` and ``join`` to convert between strings and lists
1. Students need more practice with the following related to template literals:
   1. Using ``format()``.
   1. Using ``{}`` to insert variables.
1. Emphasize the difference between what a list method _returns_ vs. how that method affects the original list
1. Studio intro:
   1. The studio tonight is a fairly straightforward application of string and list methods. Remind students that their TAs and the appendices in the book are good for syntax reminders.
   1. This studio is also a great time to play around with the code. Encourage the students to ask themselves "What if I try..." after completing a particular step in the activity.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Recalling the proper syntax for the required string and list methods.
   1. Setting up template literals.
   1. Remembering to convert numerical user inputs from strings to numbers.
   1. Setting up an ``if / else`` statement to validate user input.
1. Deal with the issues above as they occur in your session - this is a good time for individual check-ins.
1. Encourage your students to play after they finish a particular task. Prepare some "What if..." or "What about trying..." questions for students who need a friendly prompt.
