# Final Project: Checkpoint Two

For the second checkpoint, students are submitting their work from EDA on their dataset. They should have the necessary dataset files and their notebook in their submitted GitHub repo.

The EDA checkpoint file should include the following:
1. Library imports
1. Create Series and or DataFrames for exploring data
1. Visualization of data
1. Summary that answers the following:
  - Was there anything surprising about the dataset?
  - Any remaining concerns about the dataset?
  - Anything that should be noted before the next phase of the assignment (cleaning data)

Learners may complete this checkpoint in tandem with checkpoint three, which is okay. They will need to make sure that the appropriate work is completed in their respective notebooks. For example, they should not be cleaning data in this notebook, and they should not be exploring or visualizing in the checkpoint three notebook.
