# Tableau Part 4: Dates and Stories

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. How Tableau handles dateime data.
1. How they can apply best practices for visualizations in Tableau.
1. What a story is in Tableau and how to create one.

## Announcements
1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
1. Much of the reading is about best practices and some learners may struggle to get a handle on these. If this is the case, try walking through the Viz of the Day on Tableau or another visualization/story that you enjoy and leading a discussion on how the author followed best practices. The more examples the learners see, the better they will get!


## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Learners will be working in groups and taking on different aspects of the same dataset. Encourage learners to follow best practices at all times!
