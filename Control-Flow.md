# Booleans, Conditionals, and Control Flow 

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. The boolean data type and boolean expressions
1. Logical operators (`>`, `<`, etc.) and `==` 
1. Logical `and` and `or`
1. `if / elif / else` statements
1. The difference between `for` and `while` loops and when to use either loop

## Announcements
1. Check with your program manager for any announcements!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Lesson Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Check to see if there are any lingering questions for the prep work for the course on the Data and Variables chapter.
   1. Recommend walking through the exercises for booleans and conditionals and loops to 
1. Review the meaning of the truth tables for logical `and` and logical `or`.
1. Clarify with live coding examples:
   1. The difference between an `if / else if` block and two successive `if` blocks
   1. Nested conditionals
1. There is no studio for today! Today is an open work day to help students catch up since there is so much coding content in the first four days to prepare for pandas.
