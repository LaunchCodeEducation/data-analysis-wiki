1. Differences between correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
1. Differences between subqueries and nested-subqueries.
1. Differences between `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
1. Learners may struggle to understand the differences between correlated and non-correlated or self-contained subqueries. This may require additional attention during lecture!
  - It may be useful to include more examples or use cases for both

## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Students will be working with the `BooksDB` dataset from lesson 10. They should already have access to this but ensure they have the necessary permissions to perform queries against the database!
