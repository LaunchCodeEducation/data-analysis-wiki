   1. Differences between a class and an object
1. How to declare a class and:
   1. Add methods and properties,
   1. How to use ``__init__()`` and ``self``.

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Reminder that the second graded assignment is due soon!
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any other announcements.

### Lesson 6 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Q & A for making the class methods work in the exercises.
1. Review the difference between a *class* and an *object*.
1. Live code the creation of a class (e.g. ``Car``):
   1. Syntax review,
   1. Use ``__init__()`` to add properties,
   1. Create two ``Car`` objects.
1. Studio intro.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Some students might try to use object literals instead of the ``CrewCandidate`` class to create the three required objects. Reinforce the benefits of declaring and using a class.
   1. Be prepared to review the syntax for ``__init__()``, as well as how to define properties and methods within a class.
1. Encourage students who finish early to complete the Bonus Mission or start the prep work for next class.
1. As always, check in with each of your students.
