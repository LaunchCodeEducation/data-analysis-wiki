# Student Data

Attendance records, grades, and other progress indicators can be found in Canvas. Each data point has a specific use.

Remember that Canvas is the source of truth in regards to the student's status in the class.

## Data Stored in Canvas

* Attendance record
  * Manually entered by TFs
  * **Counts toward** final grade for student
* Graded Assignments
  * Manually scored and entered by TFs
  * **Counts toward** final grade for student
* Concept Checks
  * Auto-graded
  * **Does NOT count** toward final grade for student

## Student Work

Early in the class student work is stored in *repl.it*, while later in the class *github repositories* are used.

1. Exercise Solutions: These are in class practice and are reviewed but **NOT graded**.
1. Studio Solutions: In class practice that is reviewed but **NOT graded**.
1. Graded Assignment Solutions: At home work that **is graded**.

# Grading

## Solutions
[The solutions repository](https://gitlab.com/LaunchCodeEducation/lc101-solutions-unit1/-/tree/csharp) on gitlab.com contains solutions for graded assignments,
studios, and some of the exercises. Ask a LaunchCode staff member to add you to the repository.

## Attendance

To record attendance in Canvas, find the attendance *assignment* for the class you are monitoring.

Note in some versions of this course, the attendance assignment will be a *quiz* that is filled out by the student and automatically recorded.

## Graded Assignments

Graded assignment scores are recorded in Canvas.

1. Review the student's work
   1. Work will be in repl.it or github
   1. A live demo may also be required depending on assignment instructions
   1. If the solution comes with a rubric, use the rubric to double check that the student's solution meets all of the requirements. If something is missing, do NOT use the rubric as feedback. Tell the student directly what elements are missing.
1. Enter grade in Canvas
   1. If the code meets the requirements, then mark the assignment complete in Canvas
   1. More about feedback in the [feedback section](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-programming-csharp/wiki/Grading-and-Student-Progress#feedback)
