## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. How to create table calculations
1. How to create parameters
1. How to create a new relationship between two tables

## Announcements

1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Calculations: Table calculations may be difficult for learners to understand and may be worthwhile to demo a table calculation during lecture.
1. Parameters: It is important to understand that parameters do not function on their own and that they need to be incorporated into the visualization through other means (calculated field, filter, reference line)
1. Relationships: This was covered as they were asked to create one during the exercises. It is probably worth talking about what is actually happening behind the scenes when a relationship is created. We tried to include as much detail as we could without going too far out of scope here.

## Studio (IA Notes)
1. Learners also have to createa relationship for the studio.
1. They perform EDA, create calculations, and parameters. They also rename titles and labels on their charts to provide additional clarity when presenting their findings.
