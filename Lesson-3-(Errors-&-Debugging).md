# Lesson 3: Errors and Debugging

## In the prep work this week, the students learned:

1. Three common error types (syntax, runtime, logic)
1. How to work through debugging errors in all three error types
1. How to use ``print`` to help debug code

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Note the due date for the first graded assignment (should be 2 - 4 weeks away).
1. The assignment will be active in Canvas soon, and the students should know enough to begin the first part of the assignment.

### Lesson 3 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Recommend walking through the debugging exercises to reinforce how to spot the different error types, how to use error messages to find bugs, and how to systematically find and fix logic errors.
1. Share stories of bugs you have encountered on the job and how you worked through them and solved them.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. The studio has students work through bugs slowly. This would be a good studio to have students pair up and talk through the steps together.
1. Show students your process when working through a bug. Talk about why and how your process works for you!
