# EDA with Spreadsheets

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. What Exploratory Data Analysis is.
1. How to calculate summary statistics in Google Sheets.
1. How to create basic visualizations in Google Sheets.

## Announcements
1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Recommend walking through the exercises since the studio covers the same dataset.
1. Review the summary statistics highlighted in the chapter.
1. Focus on EDA concepts and best practices.
1. If you can think of a time when you discovered an outlier, please share! This can be a fun personal story to help the students understand the importance of EDA.

## Studio (IA Notes)

### Best Practices for ALL Studios
1. Check in with EVERY student during EVERY studio.
   1. This builds relationships and trust, and it helps you spot potential issues before they get too large.
   1. Checking in does NOT mean a quick question like, "How are you doing? Need any help?" Instead, sit next to the student and ask specific questions about their code, their interpretation of the instructions, or their coding dreams.
   1. Provide detailed feedback as often as possible. "Good job!" does not cut it. An example would be "Hey! I like your variable names! They are very descriptive!".
1. Be prepared to clarify the studio instructions beyond just re-reading the words on the screen.
1. Encourage students to work together and share ideas.
1. Assist individuals as questions arise. Address frequent mistakes and/or questions to your whole group.
1. Make a note of any issues that occur during the studio and provide that feedback to the instructor and LaunchCode team.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Students will have needed to do the exercises to get going on the studio. Check the exercise solutions to help students who didn't complete get caught up, if necessary.
1. Students should partner up at the end of the studio to discuss what they found. If someone is hesitant to partner up, you may have to choose their partner for them or if they are the odd one out, don't hesitate to be their partner and talk about what you may have found!
