# Methodology

## Blended Learning

The course is delivered using a combination of online tasks, face-to-face instruction, small peer group time, and programming assignments. The varied delivery is meant to reinforce the concepts by accommodating different learning styles. The day's concepts and objectives will be introduced at home via online reading and exercises. In-class time will be spent reviewing concepts, answering questions, walking through live-coding examples, and working on small programming tasks called studios.

## Course Goals

Teach students, from wide ranging backgrounds, these topics:

* Learn how to learn (learning mindset)
* Problem solving skills
* How to use spreadsheets in data analysis projects
* Basic programming using Python
* Introduction to databases in SQL
* Importing, cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis, and reporting with visualizations made in Tableau
* Introduction to statistical modeling

This content is meant to be a start and not the finish. With these skills students can proceed into more complex areas.

# Class Structure

* Prep work
  * Tasks student do **during assigned reading time**
  * Reading chapters and concept checks
* Primary Instruction
  * Led by the instructor
  * Includes lecture and live coding examples
* Exercises
  * Students work independently or in small groups
  * Class discussion and review of exercises as needed
* Studio
  * Students separate into assigned groups
  * Group work with IA check-ins
  * Designed to be **safe practice time** for students with support
  * Class discussion and review as needed
* Assignments
  * Completed independently
  * Graded assignments for which students are given multiple weeks to complete
  * Typically worked on outside of class, unless provided "open working time" by IA

# Tasks and Responsibilities
Course staff members are crucial to the success of the students. These tasks help ensure that everyone knows
their role in the process.

## Instructors

* Report Issues to LaunchCode (LC) staff
  * Contact LC staff by Discord or email.
  * LC staff needs to know about issues with: students, tas, facilities, curriculum, course tools
    * [For issues requiring changes to the curriculum material, including bugs](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/data-analysis/wiki/Course-Overview-and-Structure#Bug-and-Issue-Reporting)
* Facilitate large group (full class) activities
  * Examples
    * What to review/demo in primary instruction
    * Decide whether to bring the class back together after studio time
    * Decide whether to hold a ta standup after class
* Monitor and respond to student struggles
  * Look for signs of students struggling and falling behind
  * Use feedback from students and tas to determine how to cover the topic more effectively.
  * Adjust examples and descriptions of topics as needed.
* Manage and coach IAs

## Instructional Assistants (IAs)

IAs will be assigned a group of students to guide.

* Assist individual students
  * Check on each student in your group at least once every class
  * Answer individual student questions
  * Help an individual student through a code problem
* Monitor and respond to individual student struggles
  * Ask how the student feels about the current topic? Do they understand it?
  * Look at student submissions to see if the are attempting quizzes, exercises, and studios.
* Facilitate studios and other small-group activities
  * Deliver the activities listed in Canvas
* Grading
  * TAs are responsible for verifying student work and entering a grade into Canvas
* Feedback
  * Provide the students specific and timely feedback on assignments, studios, and tasks
  * Provide ideas to the LaunchCode staff on how to make the course better

## Students

* Pay attention to assignments in Canvas
* Do the prep work
* Attend class and participate in activities
* Turn in graded assignments on time
* Do their own work

## Bug and Issue Reporting

Students should notify their IA or instructor of any issues they find in course materials (typos, bugs, etc). Course staff should assess the issue and gather as much info as possible. If the issue is indeed with course materials (some student concerns are the result of misreadings, bad student code, etc) then they should raise the issue with the TechEd Team. To submit an issue, do one of the following:

- Email the TechEd Team at education@launchcode.org
- Create a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/data-analysis-curriculum/issues)
