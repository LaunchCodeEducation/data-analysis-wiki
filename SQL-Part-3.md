# SQL Part 3

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. What a join is.
1. Write queries that use inner, full, left, and right joins.
1. Explain the differences between the types of joins listed above.
1. Use the `HAVING` clause with joins to filter result sets.

## Announcements

1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Students practiced queries with the four different types of joins. Make sure to differentiate betweent the four different types of joins. If you have any tips or tricks for knowing when to use each join, make sure to share them!

## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Students will be writing a lot of queries at once. They really need to follow best practices to make sure they don't return too many rows at once and cause the server to slow down for the rest of the class.
