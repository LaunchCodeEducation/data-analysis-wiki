# Introduction to Data

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. What the different stages of a data analysis project are.
1. Different data analysis methods and techniques and use cases.
1. How to review a dataset and speak to what metrics are important.

## Announcements
1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
  - The exercises involve reviewing the museum of modern art dataset and answer various questions. It is important that the learners continue to think about the questions asked here in future exercises, studios and assignments!
1. The data project life cycle will be a theme throughout the entirety of this course. This may be a good time to provide your own experience with a project that you have worked on in during your career.

## Studio (IA Notes)

### Best Practices for ALL Studios
1. Learners will work in a small group to discuss a potential data analysis project.
  - Assign each small group a scenario available from the studio walkthrough page.
1. Be prepared to clarify the studio instructions beyond just re-reading the words on the screen.
1. Make a note of any issues that occur during the studio and provide that feedback to the instructor and LaunchCode team.
