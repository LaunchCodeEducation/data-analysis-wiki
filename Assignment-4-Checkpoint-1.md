# Final Project: Checkpoint One

For the first checkpoint, students are submitting their chosen dataset and their business issue. Make sure that they have included both of those items on their Canvas submission.

You can also give them input on whether or not there is a dataset that might better suit their needs.

On the due date, set aside some time during the studio for everyone to discuss what their business issue is and how their chosen dataset works with that.

Dataset Checks:
1. Is the usability score higher than 7?
2. Is it less than 50 MB?
3. Is it in the public domain or does it have a different type of licensing?
4. Is it going to help them address their business issue?
5. Based on your experience, is there anything else the student should be aware of about their chosen dataset?

We have provided some sample submissions for you to give you an idea of what the student submissions should look like.
