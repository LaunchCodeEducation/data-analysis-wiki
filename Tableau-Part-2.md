# Tableau Part 2: Data Preparation

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. About Tableau's query pipeline and how different filters impact performance.
1. Implementing filtering and sorting in Tableau's worksheets.
1. Working with hierarchies in Tableau and implementing custom hierarchies.
1. Organizing data into groups in Tableau and how to use sets.

## Announcements

1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. If you have any examples from your work about why you might use different filters, please share! Learners will get the hang of filtering in Tableau eventually and there are a lot of different reasons to choose a specific filter.
   1. Emphasize the difference between groups and sets if you can. An additional example might be helpful with this topic too.

## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Students have a lot to accomplish during studio time. You might have to jump in a lot at the beginning to make sure that all their data is properly imported before they can begin working on visualizing their data.
