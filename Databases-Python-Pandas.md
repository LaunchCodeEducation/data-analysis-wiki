## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. How to establish a connection to a sqlite3 database using python.
1. How to create a new cursor object to interact with the database and execute commands.
1. Create a pandas DataFrame using data from a sqlite database
1. Adding data from a DataFrame back into the sqlite database

1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
1. It may be worthwhile covering how to connect to a database that is not sqlite, even if they are not expected to do so in exercises or studio.
1. Covering SQL injection attacks and why it is important to use parameterized queries.

## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Students will be using a TV shows dataset from Kaggle but the CSV file is already included in the studio directory.
1. Students are given the choice of using pandas or SQL to manipulate their data. Encourage them to think about what they need to accomplish before choosing.
