# Assignment 1: Fintech Fun

For this assignment, students use Google Sheets to perform an EDA and clean two different datasets. They need to write up their findings in a document called "Final Report".

They are submitting their folder with their two datasets in Google Sheets and their report document. They are required to have done the following:

1. An EDA and cleaning of the Debt Repayment Plan spreadsheet.
1. Select three home pricing factors from the dataset on Kaggle and load their chosen three into a Google Sheet. 
1. Perform an EDA and clean all three chosen home pricing factors. 
1. Answer all questions in the report document based on what they discovered during EDA and data cleaning.

## Feedback and Grades

If a student's work passes all the requirements listed above, assign them a score of 1/1 in Canvas.

As with all graded assignments, we encourage you to provide feedback about your students' analytical approach. The instructions for this assignment are intentionally nebulous. There is little guidance on what Google Sheets actions they have to do to meet the requirements and therefore students' analytical approach may benefit from some advice.

If a student's work does not meet one or more of the requirements, provide them with detailed feedback about which parts need to be improved.
