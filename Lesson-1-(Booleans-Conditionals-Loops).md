# Lesson 1: Booleans, Conditionals, and Control Flow 

## In the prep work for the course, the students learned:
1. How the class platforms and structure are set up.
1. How to assign variables.
1. The integer, float, and string data types and how to convert between them
1. The mathematical operators (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``**``, ``%``, ``++``, ``--``) and order of operations
1. The ``type()`` method and how to collect user input with ``input()``

## In the prep work for the first class, the students learned:

1. The boolean data type and boolean expressions
1. Logical operators (``>``, ``<``, etc.) and ``==`` 
1. Logical ``and`` and ``or``
1. ``if / elif / else`` statements
1. The difference between ``for`` and ``while`` loops and when to use either loop

## Announcements
1. Welcome! First day pep talk
1. Lesson 2 prep work should be active by the end of class.

## Large Group Time (Instructor)
### First Class Reminders
1. Use Canvas to access course content.
1. Have a repl.it account:
   1. Review workspace panels and important menu items (this can be done in the live coding examples).
1. Set expectations for students:
   1. Do ALL of the prep work before class.
   1. Ask questions often.
   1. Make use of the help and resources available.
1. Introduce the TFs and assign groups (may be done during the studio intro).
1. Other relevant contact information.

## Announcements
1. Welcome! First day pep talk
1. Lesson 2 prep work should be active by the end of class.

### Lesson 1 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Check to see if there are any lingering questions for the prep work for the course on the Data and Variables chapter.
   1. Recommend walking through the exercises for booleans and conditionals and loops to 
1. Review the meaning of the truth tables for logical ``and`` and logical ``or``.
1. Clarify with live coding examples:
   1. The difference between an ``if / else if`` block and two successive ``if`` blocks
   1. Nested conditionals
1. Today the studio is a non-coding activity.
   1. Refer to the TF Notes and prepare a brief intro about why this activity will benefit the students.

## Studio (TF Notes)

### Best Practices for ALL Studios
1. Check in with EVERY student during EVERY studio.
   1. This builds relationships and trust, and it helps you spot potential issues before they get too large.
   1. Checking in does NOT mean a quick question like, "How are you doing? Need any help?" Instead, sit next to the student and ask specific questions about their code, their interpretation of the instructions, or their coding dreams.
   1. Provide detailed feedback as often as possible. "Good job!" does not cut it. An example would be "Hey! I like your variable names! They are very descriptive!".
1. Be prepared to clarify the studio instructions beyond just re-reading the words on the screen.
1. Encourage students to work together and share ideas.
1. Assist individuals as questions arise. Address frequent mistakes and/or questions to your whole group.
1. Make a note of any issues that occur during the studio and provide that feedback to the instructor and LaunchCode team.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Even though this is a non-coding studio, it requires more preparation and thought than usual.
1. The studio helps the students build confidence and identify what they want to get out of this class, so it is critical that you play your part well.
1. Refer to the notes you received from LaunchCode as you prepare for and run the studio. You can also access the notes [here](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/blob/master/wiki-materials/Goal-Setting-and-Mindset-TA-Notes.pdf).
