# Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:
- How to create and manipulate Lists
    - that they are ordered collections similar to arrays
- Bracket notation, iteration, common list methods
- How to create and utilize dictionaries with python
- How to create and when to use Tuples
    - Understand benefits and drawbacks of dictionaries vs. lists vs. tuples

## Announcements
1. Check with your program manager for any announcements!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Check to see if there are any lingering questions for the prep work for the course on the Loops chapter.
1. Review strings as collections, common use cases for lists, dictionaries, and tuples
1. Clarify with live coding examples:
   1. when to use a list vs. a dictionary
1. The studio covers strings and lists as they are more common for beginners. The studio has an optional portion that dives into multi-dimensional lists - since this is optional it may be beneficial to cover them during lecture.

### Lesson Topics That Require Careful Attention
- Multi-dimensional lists
- Dictionary use cases
- Tuple use cases
- Iteration
    - both list and dictionaries
- Bracket notation
