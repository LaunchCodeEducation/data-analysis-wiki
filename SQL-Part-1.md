# SQL Part 1

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. What relational databases and SQL are.
1. How to write basic SQL queries.
1. What are primary and foreign keys and why table relationships matter.

## Announcements
1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Students practiced writing SQL queries a lot. Make sure when discussing SQL queries to remind them to think about the result set returned and how they can follow the best practices introduced at this stage in their learning.

## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Students will be writing a lot of queries at once. They really need to follow best practices to make sure they don't return too many rows at once and cause the server to slow down for the rest of the class.
