# SQL Part 5

## In the prep work for this class, the students learned:

1. What a schema is.
1. How to create new tables and add new records to existing tables.
1. How to update existing tables.
1. How to remove records from a table and delete tables.

## Announcements

1. Always check with your program manager to see if there are any upcoming deadlines you should highlight!
   1. The deadline for Graded Assignment 3 should be coming up!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Students practiced creating, updating, and deleting within their own schemas. You should review what a schema is to make sure that everyone did so properly. Their accounts only have permission to alter objects in their schema so if they were not running queries within their own schema, they may have experienced issues with the prep work.
   1. When we talk about creating tables, we talk about temp tables. If you have an example from your work that emphasizes best practices and why we might want to use a temp table, please do share it so that students can understand it better!

## Studio (IA Notes)

1. Students will be working with starter data so they should not be returning too many rows. Encourage them to try out the bonus mission if they have leftover time!
