# Final Project: Checkpoint Three

For the third checkpoint, students are submitting their work cleaning their dataset. They should have their necessary dataset files and their notebook in their submitted Github repo.

Make sure that their cleaning data includes:

1. Library imports
2. Testing and handling missing data
3. Testing and handling irregular data
4. Testing and handling unnecessary data
5. Testing and handling inconsistent data

**Note**: Students may not find a certain type of dirty data in their data and that is okay!  

Students should also answer the questions in the "Summarize Your Results" and leave comments in their code explaining their thought process.

If students work on this checkpoint in tandem with the second checkpoint, that is okay. They just need to make sure that the appropriate work is in each notebook. For example, they should not be handling missing data or removing duplicates in their EDA notebook.
